# Constraint-Task-Scheduler: A task scheduler utilizing constraint programming.

If you have a bunch of tasks to do in a week, and you have only so many hours in each day of the week, how do you figure out what to do and when?

This is a IPython notebook using constraint programming to answer that question.

- Tasks are defined with work effort in hours
- The schedule for the week is defined by assigning each day with available free hours.
